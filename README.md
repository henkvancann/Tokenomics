## Why
Tokenization is hot. Steaming hot, and able to create rampant metastases. We need to cool the topic with transparency, protection, and realism. Why? Because people and organizations can burn their fingers when they touch tokens.

Our vision stems for open public cryptocurrencies and the ecosystems behind them. Not your keys not your coins, don't trust verify. The drive in our group to shine a light on the most important issues around Tokenomics stems from experience in business and finance.

## For who
Anyone getting involved with tokens, either as a creator, seller, buyer, facilitator, or regulator needs a standard and a benchmark to able to refer to as soon as interrelated features of tokens in a certain practical context are discussed. 

## A token is a moving target

The appearance or the analysis of any token changes along at least three axes
1. the individual perspective of the observer ([roles](./Docs/Legend.md#Role-based-perception-of-tokens))
2. The lifecycle of a token
3. Maturity of classification methods (see also [Comparison of methods](./Docs/ComparisonTC.md) )

#### Hoovering over the subject
With so many variables and uncertainties in the premature field of Tokenization, you always should ask the question "What are we doing, what are we really constructing here?". <br/>
The outcome of a classification or an exercise to put a real world situation in a taxonomy framework often turns out to be a waste of time. It serves no real purpose. Except for a detailed dertermination of what we are talking about: a token and its characteristics.

**Designing a token, classify the token, put it in a legal context, check the assetbacking, do the reality check, etc... still won't create anything valuable yet.**

#### Having said that, that we happily offer:
 - [Definitions and extended glossary](./Docs/Legend.md)
 - [Examples](./Docs/Examples.md) of tokenization
 - More detailed [objectives](./Docs/Objectives.md) of this project
 - A list of [roles](./Docs/Legend.md#Role-based-perception-of-tokens) that stakeholders in a token ecosystem can fullfil<br/>
These are the benefits of getting our group involved:<br/>
1. Classification method [comparison](./Docs/ComparisonTC.md)
2. Deterministic token classification
3. Validation 
4. [Reality check](./Realitycheck.md) of the parameters
5. [Assetbacking](./Docs/Assetbacking.md)
6. Future role of [Artifical Intelligence](./Docs/AI.md)
7. [Legal Embedding](./Docs/Legal.md), however reduced and focussed on taxation and legal tender issues
